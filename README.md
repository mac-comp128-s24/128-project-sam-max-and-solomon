# Memory Match
Memory Match is a classic card matching game. Click on a card to flip it over, and then click another card. Click one more time! If the cards match, they'll be removed from the board and your score will increase. If they don't match, they'll turn back over and 5 points will be deducted from your total. Try to match all the cards to win!

Run the game by running the main function of the Game file. When you are done, you can exit out of the canvas.
